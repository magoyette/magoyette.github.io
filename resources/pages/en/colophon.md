## Constraints

I chose to adopt some constraints while building this web site.

**Static site**: The web site will be static and generated with my own static site generator.

**JavaScript**: Avoid as much as possible the use of JavaScript.

**Tracking**: Do not add Google Analytics or other trackers.

## Fonts

The majority of the text on this web site use two open source fonts created by [Huerta Tipográfica](https://www.huertatipografica.com/en):

- Titles use [Alegreya](https://github.com/huertatipografica/Alegreya), a serif font.

- Texts use [Alegreya Sans](https://github.com/huertatipografica/Alegreya-Sans), the sans serif equivalent of Alegreya.

I chose these two fonts because of their litterary appearance. They create a different ambiance than the popular sans serif fonts that are used all around the web.

Code blocks use a monospace font that varies depending on the fonts installed on the operating system.
