## Constraints

I chose to adopt some constraints while building this web site.

**Static site**: The web site will be static and generated with my own static site generator.

**JavaScript**: Avoid as much as possible the use of JavaScript.

**Tracking**: Do not add Google Analytics or other trackers.

## Fonts

The text on this web site use [Alegreya](https://github.com/huertatipografica/Alegreya), an open source font created by [Huerta Tipográfica](https://www.huertatipografica.com/en).

Code blocks use a monospace font that varies depending on the fonts installed on the operating system.
